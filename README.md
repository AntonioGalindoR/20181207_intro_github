## Introduction to version control using GitHub

- Date and time: 7th December 2018, 14:00 - 15:30
- Location: [Bioinformatics Training Facility](http://map.cam.ac.uk/Craik-Marshall+Building), University of Cambridge, UK
- [Programme](https://e.issuu.com/anonymous-embed.html?u=bioinfocambs&d=bioinformaticsforbiologists_dec2018)

## Overview

Have you ever wondered how to keep automatic control of the different versions of your research documents, computer scripts and data sets? In this session we will learn the basics of Git and GitHub so that you can then develop version control for your own research projects.

## Background and motivation

- When reproducing someone's previous work or your own past work, researchers very often benefit greatly from having access to detailed documention of the methods used e.g. how were the experiments done? How were the computational analyses performed?

- In many cases you don't only want to see a single static version of the project but may want to have access / keep track of the different versions of the project e.g. how did the project looked like 1 year ago?

- Some of the existing manual approaches to version control have **clear limitations**:

- In the context of bioinformatics scripts and software, the scientific community is beginning to consider the value of peer reviewing computer code - see Nature Methods August 2018 editorial [**Easing the burden of code review**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0137-5):

*An increasing share of modern research relies on analytical code and software. In turn, a good deal of irreproducible research can be attributed to computational tools that are difficult to decipher, use or recreate. Through the concerted efforts of computational researchers and stricter guidelines from publishers, the culture of scientific software is now more open and geared toward dissemination than ever [...]*

- Git and GitHub are some of best-known tools for releasing / sharing / version control scripts and computer code developed as part of a project or manuscript.
